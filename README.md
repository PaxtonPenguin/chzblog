# chzblog
a (very) simple php blog software

## setup
you'll need to edit the add.php to add your password hash

the hash method is sha256

## why php?
because screw you

real answer: php isn't really that bad and if you know what you're doing, it's fine

## files
index.html - the index that you'll need because comment reasons

add.php - the main blog script, does everything except upload files

add.html - the interface for add.php (and upload.php i guess)

upload.php - the image uploader that means this isn't 1 script
