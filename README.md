# chzblog
a (very) simple php blog software

## setup
you'll need to edit the add.php to add your password hash

the hash method is sha256

## why php?
because screw you

real answer: php isn't really that bad and if you know what you're doing, it's (usually) fine

## files
index.html - the index that you'll need because comment reasons

add.php - the main blog script, does everything except upload files

add.html - the interface for add.php (and upload.php i guess)

upload.php - the image uploader that means this isn't 1 script

setup.html - the setup interface

setup.php - the setup script

admin.html & admin.php - admin panel that doesn't do anything

## limitations
only 1 post per day

sorry if you're the type of person to post multiple times per day, but all the blogs i've seen are once per day
